With three-to-eight times the fiber of other cereal grains, Sustagrain can be a potent tool for weight management, heart health, digestive health, blood sugar management and increased satiety.</p>
			<p><span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bolder; color:#993300">Sustagrain's macronutrient composition</span> sets it apart. More than 50% of its carbohydrates are present as total dietary fiber, and 40% of those are in the form of cholesterol-lowering beta glucan. That works out to roughly three times the total dietary and soluble fiber of conventional whole oats. And with less than half the starch of most cereals, Sustagrain's glycemic index (GI) ranks among the lowest you'll find in commercially available grains, which translates into increases satiety and sustained energy release.</p>
			<p>Combine these credentials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's endorsement of a heart-health label claim for barley-containing foods, and it's easy to see why Sustagrain has earned a reputation as a must-have next-generation food ingredient.</p>

			<p>ConAgra Mills is working to educate those who work with diabetics, like dietitians, on the benefits of Sustagrain, since it appeals to the palate as well as being a healthy alternative to more traditional flours.</p>
			<p>Sustagrain is offered to companies as a food substitute for flours&mdash;a replacement that can increase the health value of foods. It may be used for nearly anything, from baked goods to rice pilaf to meatloaf, to boost the nutritional value of a food product.</p>

			<span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bolder; color:#993300">Looking for a novel way to bring whole grain goodness to your school district's menus?</span> You can't beat Sustagrain for its appealing flavor and superior health benefits&mdash;especially when you consider its soluble beta glucan fiber. With ConAgra Mills' Sustagrain, you can deliver that whole grain goodness with a flexibility and functionality you won't find in any other whole grain.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size:16px; font-weight:bolder; color:#993300">Flake and flour forms</span> give manufacturers plenty of practical alternatives for formulation. Designed to boost fiber but not bulk, Sustagrain ingredients improve everything from breads, hot cereals, bars, and pastas to desserts and meat preparations.</span></p>
