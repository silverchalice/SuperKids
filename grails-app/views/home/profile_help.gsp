        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>Your School District Profile is used to determine the types of products that you can order. For example, flour products are only available to school districts that proof and bake, and some products are not available in all regions and states.</p>
        <h2>Required Fields</h2>
        <p>Fields in red are required so that we have the right address to send your samples to, and so that we can send you an email telling you when your sample order has shipped.</p>
        <h2>Number of Students</h2>
        <p>Select the option that comes closest to the total number of students served in your entire school district - not just the number of students in your immediate school or location.</p>
        <h2>Approximate Number of Cafeterias, Food Courts, etc.</h2>
        <p>Select the option that comes closest to the total number of eating facilities in your entire school district.</p>
