		<h4>Greetings ${ecard?.recipient}</h4>
	    <p style="width:800px">
			Whole grain foods are important for our nation's school-age children. I sent you this card because I wanted you to know about a unique program known as SuperKids -- a FREE whole grain product sampling program for K-12 school foodservice directors featuring better-for-you whole grain products made with Ultragrain and Sustagrain. Your school district may find these products of interest. Click here to go to the <a href="http://www.superkidssampling.com">SuperKids</a> website where you can request product information.
